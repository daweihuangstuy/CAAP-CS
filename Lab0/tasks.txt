 Task 7
 
 Finding --no-mouse option
 commit SHA : commit c7e86ad4f1061b0cad9f64a6c9ad26f386bc1168
 
 After I cloned the repository to my home directory, I cd into the directory and ran git log 
 in the command prompt to print out the log of commit history in my terminal. I decided to 
 copy the commit history into a txt file so I can use Notepad++'s word finder feature to locate
 the key words "--no-mouse" and found the commit when that feature was added. I then copied the
 commit SHA.
 
 git log > commit.txt
 
 -got the command to copy the contents of the terminal into a word file off of the internet.

 Task 8
 
 To see the difference between the changes you made relative to the file and the last commit,
 use the git command "git diff HEAD."

 Task 9
 
 To create a commit that would remove a give file, simply delete the file from the directory and then
 add and commit the changes that you made. In this way, you created a new commit to delete the given
 file while the history of the file's existance is maintained.

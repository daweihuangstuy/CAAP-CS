 Finding --no-mouse option
 commit SHA : commit c7e86ad4f1061b0cad9f64a6c9ad26f386bc1168
 
 After I cloned the repository to my home directory, I cd into the directory and ran git log 
 in the command prompt to print out the log of commit history in my terminal. I decided to 
 copy the commit history into a txt file so I can use Notepad++'s word finder feature to locate
 the key words "--no-mouse" and found the commit when that feature was added. I then copied the
 commit SHA.
 
 git log > commit.txt

# Dawei Huang CAAP AP CS Assignment 1

This programming portion of this assignment contains two parts. Part 1 contains 5 small miscellaneous programs that each peform a specific task. Part 2 contains one program that calculates the minimum amount of coins in a given amount of change owed. Part 1 programs are contained in hello.py and part 2 programs are contained in cash.py. These programs use python version 3.7.0

## Getting Started

To run the program, the user simply inputs hello.py or cash.py in the command terminal. The program will progress through each program in an orderly manner prompting users for inputs when necessary. The command prompt will end once the user runs through all the programs on a given file.

##Part 1: hello.py

### 1) Hello World
This program takes no inputs and prints "Hello!" on the terminal.

### 2) Converter
This program takes the input temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and output the equivalent temperature in degrees Celcius.

### 3) Unit Conversion
This program takes the input length in inches and output the equivalent length in centimeters.

### 4) Slope
This program sums a list of numbers the user inputs into the terminal. First it would prompt the user to enter how many numbers he/she would like to sum up. The program then prompts the user for each of the numbers in turn and outputs the summation of those numbers.

### 5) Fibonacci Sequence
This program returns the nth term of the fibonacci sequence. The program prompts the user to input the nth term of the fibonacci sequence and output the numerical value of that nth term.

## Part 2: Change

This program returns the least amount of coins needed for a specific amount of change as specified by the user using the concept of a greedy algorithm. The program prompts the user to enter a specific amount of change and outputs the least amount of coins needed to correspond to the value of change.

takes the input length in inches and output the equivalent length in centimeters.

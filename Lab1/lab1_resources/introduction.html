        <article>The current owner and CEO of this for-profit libertarian think tank is Dawei Huang (an image of him is shown below). He is from New York City, New York and is currently attending college at the University of Chicago.</article>
        <h3>Why a libertarian?</h3>
        <p>Dawei was triggered to become a libertarian once he started to pay his taxes. The taxes are too damn high!!! Thus Dawei became a libertarian.</p>
